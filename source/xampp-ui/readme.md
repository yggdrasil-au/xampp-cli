the xampp ui is the control panel GUI for managing XAMPP servers the original is written in perl and the win version lacks cli tooling
the new version is written in rust and is currently a purely cli based tool with plans to add a gui later in C#, the entire tool may eventually be ported to C# as well
the goal is a cross platform cli/gui tool for managing a custom built xampp server stack to run as a local web development environment with full feature support, where normal tools like vite can only run javascript based websites this tool aims to support php and other apache configs like htaccess
